## Superstore Services
Year 2 Final Project for Database II.

## Description
This project was our final project for my partner and I's databse II course.Uusing all the knowledge we have aquired to date, we created a superstore database from scratch. We first normalized the data, created the tables and inserts, and then began implementing subprograms needed for our application features (such as procedures, functions, and triggers) which we have neatly organized in packages. We then implemented everything in java using JDBC, and created a menu which lets users access the options within the menu! All dependencies for the ODBC driver have been added into maven pom.xml file according to our DB. modify as needed.

## Installation
For the installation, please make sure you have a maven extension downloaded, and please make sure to update the dependencies for the odbc driver in the pom.xml file to suit your needs. In addition, update the link to your database in the SuperstoreServices.java createConnection() method.

## Usage
To begin, run the ProjectSetup.sql script in your database. Next, run the program in your IDE of choice. Start by entering your username and password, wait for connection to be established. Once that is complete, follow the instructions on screen! Enjoy! :)
